The Benchmarks are stored in LokiJS/benchmark/
When doing benchmarking cd into that folder
    cd LokiJS/benchmark/

The following files should be benchmarked
    node benchmark.js # benchmark the common operations that are performed

    node benchmark_binary.js # benchmark the binary index

These produce a lot of output and with my initial testing the difference between the silent watchdog and the original is negligible.
To get multiple trials I would recommend only taking the ( %d ops/s) lines.
