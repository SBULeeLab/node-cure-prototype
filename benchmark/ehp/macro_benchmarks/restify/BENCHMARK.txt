The benchmarks are in node-restify/benchmark/.


run the following command for a benchmark
node node-restify/benchmark/index.js

The program will first prompt for a few options:
    I would leave all the options as the default except for "Do you want to compare HEAD with the stable release (undefined)?" which I would say No.


Results for each test are stored in node-restify/benchmark/results
