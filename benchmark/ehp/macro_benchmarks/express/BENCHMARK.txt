To benchmark set the environment variable CURRENT_NODE to the path of the node executable you want to benchmark.


The benchmark is stored in express/benchmarks

and can be run with `make`


An Example of running them is

echo "Watchdog Node"
echo $(cd express/benchmarks/ ; export CURRENT_NODE=~/JamieProject/bm/benchmark/ehp/nodes/watchdog_node/node ; make)
echo "Original Node"
echo $(cd express/benchmarks/ ; export CURRENT_NODE=~/JamieProject/bm/benchmark/ehp/nodes/original_node/node ; make)



The numbers reported by the express benchmarks are the Requests/sec that wrk sees are satisfied with an amount of middleware layers.
